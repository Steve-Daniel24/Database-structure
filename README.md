## Description:
This Java project implements a simple Course Management System, simulating basic database functionalities such as relations and tuples. It allows you to manage courses, students, and their associated details through a series of classes representing domains, attributes, and relations.

## Features:
Domain and Attribute Definition: Define various data types (e.g., Varchar, Number) and their associated attributes.

- Relation Management: Create multiple relations representing entities such as courses, classrooms, and students.

- Tuple Insertion: Insert tuples (records) into the relations.

- Selection and Projection Operations: Perform selection queries to filter tuples based on specific conditions, and project attributes from relations.

- Data Display: Display tuples for each relation, providing an overview of the current state of the data.

## Structure:
